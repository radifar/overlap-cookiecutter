This is a cookiecutter template for writing project based on Five Steps to Successful Writing from Handbook of Technical Writing 9th ed. This template is designed to help you jump-start your writing project and make every writing project that you're working on consistent.

### Why Overlap?

Because when you are writing, you are trying to convey your idea, perception, or model to your reader. Therefore after your audience read your writing they should be able to decode your writing into idea, perception, and model inside their head. And the more effective your writing there should be more **overlap** of idea, perception, and model that you are trying to convey and the one that they receive.

### How to Use this Template

Make sure you already have cookiecutter installed. Then run:

`cookiecutter gh:radifar/overlap-cookiecutter`

There will be a prompt that ask the writing project name, date, and author name. Just fill those prompt accordingly. If everything works correctly, you will have a new directory with the name of current local date + slugified writing project title.
